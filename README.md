# hello-world
My first git repository! No idea what I'm going to do with it. I feel like this is just for heavy coders/developers! I'm neither!

I used a Windows 10 - Initial Setup Script that stripped all the "bloat" from Windows, whil ei Loved the idea, it did "too much" for my liking. I spent all day trying to fix what I did - and ended with a full reinstall. But the experience with the script was "fun". I want to be able to utilize GitHub for more!
